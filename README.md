#Repository Name

Just some numpy data analysis using data posted on the official Illinois data dist website (data.illinois.gov) specifically addressing police arrests in the city of Urbana from 1988 to 2019. Nothing serious, just graphing and light analysis with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

Shoutout to Sandford Hess and Kelly Cundiff for digitizing all this in 2018. Would be nowhere without them.
